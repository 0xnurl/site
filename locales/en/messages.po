"People who do this are generally trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like one would in person or on the phone - and that's great! But it's [year]not 1990[/year] and chat is neither of those things. For most people, typing is much slower than talking. So despite best intentions, **you're actually just making the other person wait** for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity (and kinda annoying).\n"
